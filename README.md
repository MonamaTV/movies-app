It is a React project that I had recorded for my channel but yoh some technicalities... So, I am not gonna upload the video. I will just leave the code here for everyone to check.

not even mobile responsive. 

Also, the structure of the project -- not up to standard. Instead of just using custom hooks to fetch data, I opted for copying and pasting the same code accross almost all the files. DO NOT DO THIS AT HOME!
